What are the social responsibilities of business? This reading list compiles relevant thinking on the topic. (Work in progress)

## Starting Points
* [The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits - Friedman, 1970](http://websites.umich.edu/~thecore/doc/Friedman.pdf)

It is worth noting that Friedman's conclusion is slightly more nuanced than its title would suggest. His actual conclusion, quoted from his book _Capitalism and Freedom_, is this:
> there is one and only one social responsibility of business--to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.

If he is willing to impose these conditions on the pursuit of profit, why stop there? Does his prescription of playing "within the rules of the game" carry any moral weight? It seems to me that his concerns about deception, fraud, and free competition show that businesses should indeed be concerned about the public good in a way that a sole focus on profits would not allow.
